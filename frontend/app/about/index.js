            <p>duplex is an experimental speedcubing method</p>

                <li>last layer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                good systems for creating 2x3x3 blocks are already well known (F2L, RouxDFDB, Petrus, Heise) and will not be described here.
            </p>
            <p>
                the last layer is comprised of one look then a combination of two algs. the solutions for each case are generated from a list of about 40 algs.  an advantage of this approach is that since we can generate combinations from a known good list of algs, we can eliminate bad cases <span className="blue">almost*</span> entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                since several solutions exist for each case, arranging them by TODO: sorting

                initially for learning, only the first alg has to be learnt - since it must reduce to a case you already know.

                subsets of DXLL can likely be incorporated into other systems

            <pre>{`
add mirror F/B

give algs names w/ colours
click to see the alg / auto mirrored -> show middle case

rotate cube LL UI

subsets - strip first auf by rotating
select subset, generate cases that use smallest number of first algs OR shortest OR minimize auf
a>all solutions/a>
show inbetween state for solution
show cancelled version of alg if it exists
group by first alg
trainer: just alg mode

+Kirjava> that's something I'm wondering about DXLL. can you learn rules that allow you to solve cases you haven't learnt in a one by one fashion
+Kirjava> like something that applies to a group of cases
SPA mode website
provide algsets from 2ll

> duplex on cll

* add ability to select a subset, and list solutions that use the smallest quantity of first alg -> this is how to find recog patterns -> add colours to tell algs apart
* show shortest, reduce first alg
