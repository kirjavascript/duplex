            </ul>
            <p>
                good systems for creating 2x3x3 blocks are already well known (F2L, RouxDFDB, Petrus, Heise) and will not be described here.
            </p>
            <p>
                the last layer is comprised of one look then a combination of two algs. the solutions for each case are generated from a list of about 40 algs.  an advantage of this approach is that since we can generate combinations from a known good list of algs, we can eliminate bad cases <span className="blue">almost*</span> entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                since several solutions exist for each case, arranging them by TODO: sorting

                initially for learning, only the first alg has to be learnt - since it must reduce to a case you already know.
            </p>
            <p>
                subsets of DXLL can likely be incorporated into other systems

TODO:

trainer
choose alg
storage / clear all

add mirror F/B

click to see the alg / auto mirrored -> show middle case
subsets - strip first auf by rotating
select subset, generate cases that use smallest number of first algs OR shortest OR minimize auf
show inbetween state for solution
show cancelled version of alg if it exists
group by first alg
trainer: just alg mode

+Kirjava> that's something I'm wondering about DXLL. can you learn rules that allow you to solve cases you haven't learnt in a one by one fashion
+Kirjava> like something that applies to a group of cases
provide algsets from 2ll

* add ability to select a subset, and list solutions that use the smallest quantity of first alg -> this is how to find recog patterns -> add colours to tell algs apart
* show shortest, reduce first alg

done before: 270 / OLLCP
no bad algs™
