duplex is an experimental speedcubing method

TODO:

    hide cases you've already seen / learnt  
    make shortest movecount also search for least transforms
    can you learn rules that allow you to solve cases you haven't learnt in a one by one fashion, like something that applies to a group of cases
    provide algsets from 2ll
    add beginner method

    * add ability to select a subset, and list solutions that use the smallest quantity of first alg -> this is how to find recog patterns
    * show shortest, reduce first alg
