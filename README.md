Some of you may remember an [old forum post] where I outlined some ideas for an improved approach for solving the last layer.

Although there are still things left to do, this is ready to be seen.

This is a recent development by the way, I haven't been working on this for the last 7 years. Is it viable for speedcubing? Who knows. From my own experience, learning alg combos is far easier than learning algorithms; but the full set has a _lot_ of cases. Grouping and sorting in various ways seems to make learning cases a little easier. 

Future work would likely consist of finding new ways to categorise cases to make them easier to learn.
