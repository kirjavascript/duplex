    cargo +nightly web start --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

lazy static for solved positions
trim AUF for Vec<Move>
// mirror / inverse / minverse
give algs names w/ colours
click to see the alg / auto mirrored

subset chooser like 2LLui
select subset, generate cases that use smallest number of first algs
do lazy load subset cubes
3 look duplex, duplex on cll

* add ability to select a subset, and list solutions that use the smallest quantity of first alg -> this is how to find recog patterns -> add colours to tell algs apart

needs checkboxes for [ ] mirror [ ] inverse [ ] minverse

make trainer use dxll solver to generate scrambles
(trainer/2x3x3->ll)
(R' F R U2 Rw U' Rw' U2 F' U2 Rw U R' U' Rw')
for algs, look at OLL/CMLL
subset chooser (filter)
(choose how you want to learn) alg chooser |
gamification (checkbox for learnt subset / case) |
2x2x3 left as exercise for the reader |
dxll is a one look last layer method |
modernization of the petrus method |
recommend cases / list recommended
no bad algsâ„¢
leaderboard / worst case
stats / users / main
