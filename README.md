duplexLL

support wasm from the start
precompile algs into transforms

select subset, generate cases that use smallest number of first algs
3 look duplex, duplex on cll

* add ability to select a subset, and list solutions that use the smallest quantity of first alg -> this is how to find recog patterns -> add colours to tell algs apart

needs checkboxes for [ ] mirror [ ] inverse [ ] minverse
