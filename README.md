ELL example

13:11 <+Kirjava> well it took me about an hour to learn ELL last night
13:11 <+Kirjava> because nearly all cases start with the same moves
13:11 <+Kirjava> so I just had to learn AUFs
13:11 <+Kirjava> you order by starting alg, and just learn the AUF for each case
13:12 <+Kirjava> like 50% of it I didn't even try the case - "oh I just orient the flipped edges like this for these 5 cases it's always the same"
13:12 <+Kirjava> switched to the trainer, did that until I could do each case eithout looking anything up
13:13 <+Kirjava> it's a lot less hard than it may initially seem, due to sorting tricks and recog patterns
13:15 <+Kirjava> honestly, I thought it would be harder than it is
